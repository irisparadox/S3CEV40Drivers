## ðŸš€ **Project Description**

This is a **firmware** project designed for the **EMBEST S3CEV40** board, based on the **Samsung S3C44B0X** microcontroller. The firmware handles basic hardware configuration via custom drivers coded in a small library in C.

### ðŸ”§ **Key Features:**
- 7SEG **drivers**.
- LCD **character and bitmap** display.
- Buttons and keypad drivers.
- UART **configuration and management** for serial communication.
- **RTC (Real-Time Clock)** configuration and management with conversion between **BCD** and binary.
- Timer drivers for measuring **timing**, and apply **software and hardware delay**.
- Handling of **software and hardware interrupts** (IRQ and FIQ).
- Custom **Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)** for RTC tick.
- **Welcome message** via UART for system status verification.
