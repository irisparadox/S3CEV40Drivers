# ðŸ“Ÿ **Firmware Project - S3C44B0X**

> **Basic firmware for the EMBEST S3CEV40 board with Samsung S3C44B0X microcontroller**  

---

## ðŸš€ **Project Description**

This is a **firmware** project designed for the **EMBEST S3CEV40** board, based on the **Samsung S3C44B0X** microcontroller. The firmware handles basic hardware configuration such as UART interface, Real-Time Clock (RTC), and interrupts.

### ðŸ”§ **Key Features:**
- UART **configuration and management** for serial communication.
- **RTC (Real-Time Clock)** configuration and management with conversion between **BCD** and binary.
- Handling of **software and hardware interrupts** (IRQ and FIQ).
- Custom **Interrupt Service Routine (ISR)** for RTC tick.
- **Welcome message** via UART for system status verification.
